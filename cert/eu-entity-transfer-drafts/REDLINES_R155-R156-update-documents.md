**Revision** 00 (DRAFT) · **Date** 2026-06-29
**How to read:** each entry gives the **file**, the **location** to change, and the **before → after** text. "ADD" = insert new text; "REPLACE" = swap the quoted text. Placeholders in «angle brackets» are filled once officers/dates are confirmed.

> Scope note carried into every document: *The WVTA remains Swedish (Transportstyrelsen, e5). Only the manufacturer entity named on it (field 0.5) and the WMI (field 0.3 → YCB) change. The CSMS/SUMS technical content is unchanged; governance moves to Windrose Technology Antwerp NV.*

## Shared WVTA-level items (not R155/R156 system docs, but on the same critical path)
- **CoC template (COC-Windrose.doc)** — REPLACE issuer name → Windrose Technology Antwerp NV; lodge specimen signatures with Transportstyrelsen.
- **Information dossier (WDR-WH13-858-01)** — re-sign as Antwerp NV; update VIN/plate text (F7) and H1 OBD/RMI contact; cover all 50 Part III items.
- **ISO 9001 / CoP scope** — extend so Antwerp NV holds Conformity-of-Production oversight of both plants.

*DRAFT for internal review — confirm officer names, the proposed technical service, and dates before issuing.*
